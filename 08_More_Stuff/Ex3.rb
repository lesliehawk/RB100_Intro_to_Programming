# What is exception handling and what problem does it solve?

# Ruby handles errors using the Exception class that allows you
# to place built in rescues for anticipated errors
# using the begin/rescue/end syntax.
# Exception handling recieves errors and "handles" them in a way
# that the code can continue to execute
# and a whole program isn't broken by one error.
